The vulnerability arises from the application's handling of artifact URLs, where a '#' character can be used to insert a path into the fragment, effectively skipping validation. This allows an attacker to construct a URL that, when processed, ignores the protocol scheme and uses the provided path for filesystem access. As a result, an attacker can read arbitrary files, including sensitive information such as SSH and cloud keys, by exploiting the way the application converts the URL into a filesystem path. The issue stems from insufficient validation of the fragment portion of the URL, leading to arbitrary file read through path traversal.",

Exploiting this flaw could allow unauthorized manipulation of any OpenCFP user's password, particularly those without an unused password reset token. Although successful login still requires correlating the numeric user ID with an email address, the identification of likely organizers (users 1-5) may facilitate this process.",

If an HTTP request is not complete, or if the transfer rate is very low, the server keeps its resources busy waiting for the rest of the data. When the server's concurrent connection pool reaches its maximum, this creates a DoS.

This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.<BR><BR>\n\nAffected Versions:<BR>FortiWeb-7.4<BR>\nFortiWeb-7.2<BR>\nFortiWeb-7.0<BR>\nFortiWeb-6.4<BR>\nFortiWeb-6.3<BR>\nFortiWeb-6.2<P>\n\n<P>QID Detection Logic (Authenticated):<BR>\nDetection checks for vulnerable versions of FortiWeb by executing command &quot;get system status&quot;<P>",

Recursion depth is only limited by the maximum accepted packet size; depending on the environment, this may cause the packet-parsing code to run out of available stack memory, causing named to terminate unexpectedly. Since each incoming control channel message is fully parsed before its contents are authenticated, exploiting this flaw does not require the attacker to hold a valid RNDC key; only network access to the control channel's configured TCP port is necessary.<P>\n\nAffected versions:<BR>\nBIND 9.2.0 - 9.16.43<BR>\nBIND 9.18.0 - 9.18.18<BR>\nBIND 9.19.0 - 9.19.16<BR>\nBIND Supported Preview Edition 9.9.3-S1 - 9.16.43-S1<BR>\nBIND Supported Preview Edition 9.18.0-S1 - 9.18.18-S1<P>\n\nPatched Versions:<BR>\nBIND 9.16.44<BR>\nBIND 9.18.19<BR>\nBIND 9.19.17<BR>\nBIND Supported Preview Edition 9.16.44-S1<BR>\nBIND Supported Preview Edition 9.18.19-S1<P>\n\nQID Detection Logic:<BR>This unauthenticated check detects vulnerable systems by fetching the version information from the BIND service using banner.<P>",
