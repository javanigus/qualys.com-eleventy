										In today's digital age, the significance of risk management has soared, especially with the growing influence of software in various business sectors. Cyber risk, once confined to the realm of CISOs and cybersecurity teams, has now become a pervasive concern. Today, the accountability for mitigating cyber risk extends to CTOs, CEOs, and even Boards of Directors. Consequently, the role of the CISO has evolved from merely assessing cyber risk to actively eliminating and communicating it.

										As enterprises adopt the cloud, new and broader attack surfaces pose a significant risk to organizations. Most measures of risk focus on vulnerabilities and misconfigurations and ignore active threats. However, active threats are a critical part of measuring and prioritizing risk in the cloud. To make things worse, attackers are using automated techniques to exploit the dynamic nature of the cloud, making it extremely difficult to detect threats and, hence, measure and prioritize risk.</p>

										Qualys TotalCloud uses AI to detect threats, including unknown and Zero-day, a growing concern in the cloud. These detections enable Qualys TotalCloud to provide a more accurate measure of risk.</p>
