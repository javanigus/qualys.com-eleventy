										<h3>Topic 1: Elevating Vulnerability Management Programs With Integrated Risk Context </h3>
										<p>
											If you fail to prioritize the most tempting vulnerabilities, attackers will prioritize them for you. Attacks will follow. With today’s hybrid infrastructure, prioritizing vulnerabilities based on ransomware risks can be a daunting task, requiring an in-depth understanding of targeted assets, their vulnerabilities, and associated threats. Once understood, reducing risk requires balancing the needs of people, processes and technology. A new, integrated approach from Qualys can help organizations:

										<h3>Topic 3:  Sharing Common Vulnerability Visibility Between IT and Security Teams With Integrated ITSM</h3>
										<p>
											Ideally, once a critical security vulnerability is found it should be remediated by IT and Security teams working hand in glove to eliminate it. Easier said than done. Disparate toolsets, misaligned workflows, and competing priorities often get in the way, exposing the business to unnecessary risk. Effective vulnerability management requires better collaboration not only between IT and Security teams, but also between the respective toolsets they employ. Learn how Qualys can integrate with existing ITSM workflows, such as ServiceNow, enabling you to:

										If 2020 was the year IT moved virtually everywhere beyond the traditional enterprise, 2021 was the year of the high-profile attack. Many of these attacks have had a number of common characteristics, not least of which has been their impact across multiple organizations. In this session, we take a look at how adversaries have achieved such efficiency at scale – and how defenders can leverage their advantages to tackle the challenges of scale and technology diversity in response.

										<p>
											Because they open a portal to critical data, APIs have become a very common attack vector against web applications. That’s why it’s critical to build secure APIs earlier in the development pipeline. By “shifting-left” rather than waiting, the external attack surface can be reduced. Learn how the latest offering in our developer’s toolkit — Qualys API Security — can help you:
