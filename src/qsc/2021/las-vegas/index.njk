		<p>
			Asif is a passionate cybersecurity entrepreneur with a broad business and technology expertise that spans enterprise, healthcare and financial domains, and cloud, mobile and deep learning technologies. He was the founder and CTO of Layered Insight till it was acquired recently by Qualys. He is now the CTO for Container Security at Qualys. Layered Insight was a pioneer in the container security space that offered a solution for providing deep visibility and protection for containerized and serverless workloads, using an innovative application-centric approach. It's the only infrastructure and orchestration agnostic solution that's zero-touch to developers and DevOps, and fully portable for cloud and edge workloads. </p>

			<p>Asif is a pioneer in the Mobile Application Management space. Back in 2011, he identified a serious gap in the enterprise solutions being offered for BYOD, envisioned an innovative user-space virtualization solution, and founded Plursona to build that solution and realize the business vision. Plursona was acquired in 2012 by HPE (Aruba Networks) for its best-in-class technology.
