										IT is undergoing a transformation as never before. The cloud is refactoring the way computing technologies are defined and operated. DevOps trends and open source are redefining how those technologies are built and deployed. Operational technologies are reshaping the edge of enterprise networks, while a plethora of newer, “smarter” systems are shaping digital experience. Analytics and the ability of computers to learn are driving much of this innovation, powering further innovation to come. How is security evolving with all these revolutionary changes? In this session, we’ll examine the “innovator’s dilemma” facing security providers and professionals alike, and how these forces are shaping what security will become. <br>

										Endpoint Detection and Response tools are a crucial component of Threat Hunting and Incident Response for organizations of all sizes. However, the user suffers as the tools are siloed and only provide a single view of their own data.  Threat Hunting with Qualys combines a platform view of the organization’s networks, servers, endpoints, and cloud workloads to bring context to security analysts, greatly speeding up the time to detect, investigate, and respond.  You’ll learn how to use existing Qualys Cloud Apps and new innovations of the Qualys Platform to streamline, accelerate, and deliver more operational capabilities for threat hunting, malware investigation, alert triaging, and incident response. <br>
