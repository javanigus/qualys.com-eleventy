        "description": "Do you underscore your Written Information Security Plan (WISP) with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)? NIST just released version 2.0, the first major upgrade in a decade that includes several new requirements. For example, a new GOVERN function requires CISOs and CHROs to be in sync on people risks. How will the new requirements impact security and HR teams to avoid security breaches, audit failures, and litigation?\n\nJoin experts from Qualys for a live ‘AMA’ (Ask-Me-Anything) session on Tuesday, April 16 at 8 AM PT as they discuss details about the new NIST CSF 2.0 requirements and how to avoid serious consequences. Here’s what you’ll learn from two Qualys FIM technical experts:\n\n• How do NIST CSF 2.0 requirements differ from CSF 1.0?\n• What is the new GOVERN function, and how is HR now involved?\n• How can you avoid people's mistakes that lead to 99% of cloud security breaches?\n• What are the four levels of CSF maturity, and how can you attain the top level?\n• How can you implement solutions to meet all requirements and lower costs?",

However, not all FIM solutions are created equal. Critical capabilities, including File Access Management and Agentless Network Support, are required to prevent security breaches, audit failures, and litigation.\n\nJoin experts from Qualys for a live ‘AMA’ (Ask-Me-Anything) session on Wednesday, March 27 at 9 AM PT as they discuss industry trends and new attack vectors, as well as why customers are switching to Qualys FIM from other solutions, such as Tripwire. Here’s what you’ll learn from two Qualys FIM technical experts:\n\n• Which PCI DSS 4.0 requirements relate to FIM and FAM\n• Why noise cancellation can reduce false alerts and IT costs by 90%+ and ensure PCI compliance\n• How File Access Monitoring, missing from other solutions, can alert on critical host file access\n• Why support for non-agent network devices is needed for PCI DSS 4.0\n• Why file reputation and trust status are critical for FIM effectiveness\n• How scalability and adequate Linux support are inadequate with most other solutions",

        "description": "Banco Pan, a national bank based out of Brazil, came to Qualys with the challenge of better prioritizing and measuring cyber risk across over 3000 nodes. With many point solutions, SecOps were buried under more than 80k vulnerabilities were mostly SLA expired. Vulnerability and remediation processes were heavily manual, expertise to analyze zero-day threats were limited, and patching vulnerabilities across all major operating systems were laborious and slow. Banco Pan needed a better security partner that could help measure cyber risk and ultimately, eliminate vulnerabilities according to their business criticality.\n\nJoin our valued customer, Raphael Ferreira, Cybersecurity Leader at Banco Pan, as he shares how making the switch to the Qualys Enterprise TruRisk Platform helped him reduce critical vulnerabilities by over 70% and MTTR by 68%. In this 45-minute web event, Raphael Ferreira will share how Qualys VMDR was able to not only solve Banco Pans’ vulnerability prioritization challenges, but also improve security-IT operationalization via ITSM integrations and automated cyber risk reporting.",

        "description": "Banco Pan, a national bank based out of Brazil, came to Qualys with the challenge of better prioritizing and measuring cyber risk across over 3000 nodes. With many point solutions, SecOps were buried under more than 80k vulnerabilities were mostly SLA expired. Vulnerability and remediation processes were heavily manual, expertise to analyze zero-day threats were limited, and patching vulnerabilities across all major operating systems were laborious and slow. Banco Pan needed a better security partner that could help measure cyber risk and ultimately, eliminate vulnerabilities according to their business criticality.\n\nJoin our valued customer, Raphael Ferreira, Cybersecurity Leader at Banco Pan, as he shares how making the switch to the Qualys Enterprise TruRisk Platform helped him reduce critical vulnerabilities by over 70% and MTTR by 68%. In this 45-minute web event, Raphael Ferreira will share how Qualys VMDR was able to not only solve Banco Pans’ vulnerability prioritization challenges, but also improve security-IT operationalization via ITSM integrations and automated cyber risk reporting.",

However, not all FIM solutions are created equal. Critical capabilities are required to prevent security breaches, audit failures, and litigation. Also, to lower IT and security costs and efforts.  \n\nJoin experts from Qualys for a live ‘AMA’ (Ask-Me-Anything) session on Tuesday, February 20 at 9 AM PT as they discuss industry trends and new attack vectors, as well as why customers are switching to Qualys FIM from other solutions, such as Tripwire. Here’s what you’ll learn from two Qualys FIM technical experts: \n\n• Which PCI DSS 4.0 requirements relate to FIM and FAM \n• Why noise cancellation can reduce false alerts and IT costs by 90%+ and ensure PCI compliance \n• How File Access Monitoring, missing from other solutions, can alert on critical host file access \n• Why support for non-agent network devices is needed for PCI DSS 4.0 \n• Why file reputation and trust status are critical for FIM effectiveness \n• How scalability and adequate Linux support are inadequate with most other solutions",

This results in systems that don’t interact and are often too complicated to be supported by a small and resource-constrained IT staff.  SMBs need to know how to make the most of endpoint security on a limited budget and with limited resources while still being able to successfully mitigate risks, such as ransomware, and ensure compliance while not impacting business performance. \nJoin us on Thursday, February 8, at 8 AM PT for this unfiltered conversation with former Gartner analyst Rob Smith as he addresses the real-world challenges of endpoint security for SMB organizations. \nHere’s what you’ll learn during this event: \n• What are the primary needs for SMB endpoint security?\n• How do the needs of SMBs differ from large enterprises for endpoint security?\n• What do SMBs require to effectively deliver endpoint security?\n• How can you better manage and reduce risks on the endpoint?\n• How important and valid are third-party tests such MITRE ATT&CK?\n• Is anti-virus enough, or do SMBs need more advanced solutions like EDR or XDR?\n• Is ransomware a real risk for SMBs?\n• What is multi-vector EDR, and how does it compare to XDR?",

        "description": "2023 saw some of the most significant cyber breaches in history, including Okta, Clorox and MGM. At the same time, emerging technologies, an ever-evolving threat landscape, and increased legislation mean organizations can no longer be ill-informed about cyber risk.\n\nWhat will 2024 hold for security practitioners? Join two of Qualys’ security thought leaders, CISO, Jonathan Trull and CTSO, Richard Sorosina. The duo will discuss some of the biggest trends and predictions in cybersecurity for 2024 and provide insights on how security teams can prepare for the year ahead.\n\nYou’ll learn:\n\n-What organizations need to know about new cybersecurity legislation\n-How AI is changing the game for cyber attackers and defenders\n-How less than 1% of the vulnerabilities discovered in 2023 contributed the highest risk to organizations, and what this means for organizations in terms of risk-based prioritization\n-How companies can finally get control over the growing problem of unmanaged, smart and IoT devices and shadow IT",

        "description": "Today, there is a growing divide between CISOs and IT Operations. CISOs are increasingly challenged to not only secure their organization from cyber risk, but they must also measure and communicate cyber risk in business terms to new stakeholders. In fact, 47% of CISOs today report to the CEO, and nearly all CISOs regularly brief the Board of Directors on the risk posture of their organization. It perhaps should come to no surprise that the average tenure of a CISO today is under 2 years – about 1.5 years in the USA. \n\nCISOs today must shift from cyber risk enumeration to cyber risk elimination – and prove it.  Join us on 9th Jan 2024 as our very own Thomas Nuth shares how security vendors must shift their focus to meet the directives of CISOs everywhere. In this webinar, attendees will come away with informative use case references, as well as how Qualys has shifted its’ vision of cybersecurity risk management with exciting the Qualys Enterprise TruRisk Platform.",

While ‘first-party software’ provides organizations with customization and flexibility, it also leaves businesses exposed to unseen vulnerabilities left unnoticed in source code. Add in the lack of security and quality control typically supported by off-the-shelf software, and it’s clear that first-party software is a prime target for attackers looking to capitalize on the lack of related CVEs and security oversight - until now.\n\nJoin us for the launch of another Qualys innovation - First-Party Risk Management – native integration with the Qualys Cloud Platform.

        "description": "Extended Detection and Response, or XDR, certainly has garnered a lot of industry buzz as a panacea for cyber ills. But the truth is cyberattacks are getting more sophisticated. We can no longer depend on a patchwork collection of different cybersecurity products stitched together via APIs and log collectors to respond to threats in a reasonable timeframe. Done right, XDR solutions built natively on a unified platform can deliver the accurate, comprehensive picture of the attack surface that incident response and threat hunting teams need to protect their environments.",

Meanwhile, vulnerabilities continue to increase in number and severity, leaving security and IT teams with unidentified devices, misclassified assets, an overabundance of alerts and overlooked system patches. For many organizations, today’s vulnerability management programs involve multiple teams and disjointed solutions, making it difficult for organizations to identify and remediate the most serious threats.

        "description": "The digital transformation through Hybrid IT and DevOps has fundamentally changed how organizations operate – with major security implications. How do companies detect and manage vulnerabilities when the enterprise network constantly evolves, and code written this morning gets deployed this afternoon? This requires enterprises to take a proactive, continuous and automated approach to security. Join this session to learn from industry experts on how enterprises should approach vulnerability management and take a wholistic approach that goes beyond traditional metrics. The speakers will detail how enterprises can implement a fully integrated vulnerability workflow – from asset inventory/discovery to vulnerability detection to prioritization and finally to remediation and patching.",

At any given time,15-20% of the network is unseen or unmanaged. This is why the principle of maximum IT asset visibility is a fundamental prerequisite to improving your security posture. Simply put, it is difficult, if not impossible, to secure what we do not know or cannot see.",
